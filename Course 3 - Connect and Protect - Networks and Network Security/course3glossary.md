## P

**Packet sniffing:** The practice of capturing and inspecting data packets across a network

**Passive packet sniffing:** A type of attack where a malicious actor connects to a network hub and looks at all traffic on the network

**Patch update:** A software and operating system update that addresses security vulnerabilities within a program or product

**Penetration testing:** A simulated attack that helps identify vulnerabilities in systems, networks, websites, applications, and processes

**Ping of death:** A type of DoS attack caused when a hacker pings a system by sending it an oversized ICMP packet that is bigger than 64KB

**Port:** A software-based location that organizes the sending and receiving of data between devices on a network

**Port filtering:** A firewall function that blocks or allows certain port numbers to limit unwanted communication

**Proxy server:** A server that fulfills the requests of its clients by forwarding them to other servers

## R

**Replay attack:** A network attack performed when a malicious actor intercepts a data packet in transit and delays it or repeats it at another time 

**Reverse proxy server:** A server that regulates and restricts the Internet's access to an internal server

**Router:** A network device that connects multiple networks together. A router connects the internet, firewall, and server to the rest of the network.
